# The study of communism

## Preface

I am a typical IT engineer, having spent decades climbing the ladder in the IT software industry and eventually becoming the technical leader of a certain enterprise. The software I developed used to rank among the top few in the industry. Now, as I approach the age where I should know my fate, I find it difficult to maintain the same entrepreneurial passion for my current job. I've been pondering over how to change my direction or career.

For my next career, I hope it would be something that is highly meaningful and valuable to society and humanity. Secondly, I want it to be a field where I can continue to work until the day I close my eyes, without becoming obsolete or failing. I simply cannot bear the thought of having plenty of energy but just waiting for death.

Initially, I considered leveraging my strengths to independently start a business developing meaningful software systems. However, I quickly dismissed this idea. The software industry is extremely competitive and rapidly evolving, making it difficult to guarantee consistent leadership and staying up-to-date. Additionally, what you consider valuable may not necessarily be recognized by others, which would require a significant amount of effort in marketing and promotion. Interpersonal communication is a significant weakness for IT geeks like me, making the chances of success relatively slim. And if others also recognize the value, there are likely many others already working in this field, so there's no need for me to join the competition.

Secondly, I considered writing articles on management or novels. By gradually accumulating knowledge and experience, I hoped to eventually produce a great work like Lu Yao's "Ordinary World," which has influenced and inspired generations despite criticisms of his writing style. A careful reading of "Ordinary World" reveals that while there are some distracting comments and reflections in the book, overall, it is a thoughtful and powerful work. Lu Yao relied on his talent and diligence, sacrificing his marriage, family, and health, and ultimately paying with his life. Nowadays, with the popularity of large language models, writing has become increasingly accessible, making it a challenge to stand out among so many writers. Nevertheless, I am willing to give it a try, reading more books, honing my writing skills, and transforming my management experience and practices into valuable insights.

Lastly, I pondered over what constitutes the most meaningful and valuable pursuit. Surely, it lies in studying the greatest unknowns: how neurons in the brain function to produce thought, what lies beyond the boundaries of the universe, and the three ultimate philosophical questions (who am I, where did I come from, and where am I going). Based on theories like the Big Bang and the origin of species, we have a basic understanding of historical questions like "who am I" and "where did I come from." However, the question of "where am I going" remains a mystery. Although I have a rough understanding of the future of the universe according to the Big Bang theory, reading descriptions in "The Three-Body Problem" still leaves me deeply impressed. Another book that astounded me is Yuval Noah Harari's "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind," which provides a vision of the future form of humanity.

But what will the future of human society look like? Will globalization lead to a unified nation, transforming us into a global village? However, with the rise of anti-globalization forces led by certain nations, the future of globalization remains uncertain. Communism portrays a utopian society without exploitation or class differences, but its core idea of class struggle is now seldom mentioned. If even the fundamental beliefs are questioned, how can the conclusions drawn from them be trusted?

I believe this is the most meaningful and valuable subject to pursue.

As a member of the Communist Party, I and some of the other party members around me are relatively outstanding individuals: honest, kind, intelligent, and courageous. However, when I read the "Communist Manifesto" and reflect on contemporary society, I am perplexed. What class do we belong to? Who are our enemies? This inconsistency and dissonance are so intense that it can be emotionally devastating to contemplate. It feels like the Emperor's New Clothes, and everyone consciously avoids addressing these issues. Just like in my younger days, the uncertainty of the future could drive me to madness. The most rational approach then is to focus on doing well in every task at hand, rather than getting caught up in what the future holds.

Now, however, I have arrived at a point where I must consider this question. I want to delve deeply into something meaningful for all of humanity and leave this world with clarity and understanding.

Studying this subject involves several aspects: Firstly, reading and evaluating classical works such as Marxism-Leninism and exploring their historical context to identify their rationality and historical limitations. Secondly, studying Chinese and Western classical philosophy and other works. Thirdly, learning about contemporary Western theories, especially the latest research on Marxism. Finally, summarizing and envisioning the future of human society based on these studies.

Given the sensitivity of the related learning and commentary, I have chosen to post it here temporarily to avoid unnecessary trouble. If anyone is interested, they can reach out to me via email for further discussion.
